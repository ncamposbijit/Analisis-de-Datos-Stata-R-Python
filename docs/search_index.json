They are structured as lecture-style class notes, which means they follow a sequential progression across sessions. Over time, these class notes have evolved—and they will continue to do so. They have been enriched thanks to contributions from several people. I am especially grateful to Camila Vivanco, Diego Menares, Catalina Buzio, Felix Ordoñez and Benjamín Pinto for their contributions. In addition, these notes are based on a variety of publicly available materials. Throughout the notes, I provide the corresponding bibliographic references and share free resources for readers who want to deepen or consolidate their knowledge. In many cases, examples have been adapted from these additional sources. I always make an effort to cite sources appropriately, with the goal of respecting original authorship and providing readers with access to valuable references. Please let me know if you find any errors. These notes have also been updated and adapted for the course ECON 326: Introduction to Econometrics II, an undergraduate course at the University of British Columbia (UBC), 2026.

Open source: The license is free. Versatile: statistical and econometric analysis + useful programming tasks (e.g., web scraping). Flexible and reproducible: ensures reproducibility, is flexible to changes and error detection. In demand: Open-source programming languages are increasingly requested in the labor market. 2.1.2 Key and recurring terms throughout the course RStudio: Graphical User Interface. It is designed to make using R easier. Objects: Anything you store in R. For example: datasets, variables, lists of names, plots. Functions: An operation produced by code that accepts inputs and returns outputs. Packages: A set of functions grouped according to their purpose. Scripts/Code: Document that contains all commands used in a data analysis process. 2.1.3 Learning Resources Cheat sheets: material available with a summary of the main commands/packages/functions for different topics. Available at: https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/ Forums and websites: Stackoverflow Medium The RStudio Blog Books: R for Data Science Resources about R in Spanish. Bookdown 2.1.4 RStudio Interface 2.1.4.1 Four sections in RStudio The fundamental ones are: Scripts, Console, Environment/Files/Help. Scripts: Where we will develop the code. It is a notebook. Console: Where we will see the results. Environment: Where we will see the data and the information we are generating. Files: Where we will see the files associated with our projects. Help: Where we will develop the code. It is a notebook. To customize RStudio go to: Tools -&gt; Global Options. There you can change the environment color, font type, layout order. The idea is to use RStudio in the most intuitive way possible. 2.1.4.2 Writing comments It is very important to write comments throughout your code. It is also important to know how to write good comments. A very good guide that discusses this and many other things is: Code and Data for the Social Sciences: A Practitioner’s Guide. (#) to write comments in the script. If I want to mark multiple lines as comments: ctrl + shift + c 2.1.4.3 Indices It is important to write indices to document your code. To see it I must type: ctrl + shift + o Titles can be hierarchical: # The most important ## This is a bit less important ### This is a bit less important than the previous one #### The least important It is important to update it constantly to avoid losing functionality. 2.1.5 Package installation and help Packages are basically collections of functions. Packages are installed once, but they are called every time they are used. 2.1.5.1 Libraries This can be done in two ways: From the Packages tab in the bottom-right corner. Using commands install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;) Many packages at the same time: install.packages(c(&quot;dplyr&quot;,&quot;ggplot2&quot;,&quot;rio&quot;)) Common error: install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;, &quot;ggplot2&quot;) In general, it is a good idea to install them at the beginning of your work, since we commonly use the same libraries when doing data analysis. With this function, we tell R to install the package if it is not installed (something typical when we switch computers): if(!require(dplyr)) {install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;)} Load libraries: library(dplyr) If we want to see what is inside each package: ls(&quot;package:dplyr&quot;, all = TRUE) #ls = list objects Important: the package must be installed once, but loaded every time it is used. There are often updates. To check and install them: update.packages() Alternatively, I can link a package to a function using ::. If I do this, it is not necessary to load the library in order to use that specific function. However, the recommended practice is to load all the libraries of the packages I will use at the beginning. 2.1.5.2 Help function About a specific function: help(mean) ?mean mean sd About a specific package: help(&quot;dplyr&quot;) library(help=&quot;dplyr&quot;) 2.1.5.3 Useful Shortcuts Esc: interrupt the current command Ctrl + s: save tab: autocomplete Ctrl + Enter: run line Ctrl + Shift + C: comment/uncomment &lt;-: Alt + - / option + - %&gt;%: Ctrl + Shift + M (pipe) Ctrl + l: clear console Ctrl + Alt + b: run everything up to here (the arrow keys in the console allow you to view the most recent commands used) Shift + lines: select multiple lines Ctrl + f: find/replace Ctrl + Up Arrow (in the console): view previously used commands 2.1.5.4 Clear the R environment Remove all objects: rm(list=ls()) Remove only one object rm(data1) If I want to clear the console, I need to press Ctrl + L. 2.1.5.5 Identify the package of a function Sometimes we want to know which package a given function belongs to. For that, check: https://sebastiansauer.github.io/finds_funs/ ` 2.1.5.6 Error común Por ejemplo: x &lt;- &quot;hola&quot; Note that a + sign appears in the console. In these cases, RStudio stops because you probably forgot a ) or a #. You must correct the error, run the code again, and then press Esc in the console to continue executing commands. 2.1.6 R Markdown A tool for creating reports that are automatic, reproducible, and based on data that can be updated over time. Reports can be generated in Word, PDF, or HTML format. R Markdown (.Rmd) is basically an intersection between narrative text and code that generates visualizations and estimations in order to analyze data. .Rmd can generate: plain text, code chunks, plots, tables, and interactive dashboards. R Markdown is especially useful for: Routine reports: For example, a weekly report for a set of analyses that is updated over time. Analytical reports for subsets of data: For example, country-specific reports from a dataset that contains information for multiple countries. 2.1.6.1 Basic concepts Markdown is the language that allows you to write documents in plain text. Files written in Markdown have the .md extension. R Markdown is the R-specific variation. It allows you to write plain text using Markdown and embed R code. Files written in R Markdown have the .Rmd extension. knitr: An R package. It is used to read (and execute) the code chunks that we include in reports. Pandoc: Used to convert the output into a Word/PDF/HTML formatted file. It is software that is installed automatically with RStudio. 2.1.6.2 Process Source: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring/quick_tour.html 2.1.6.3 First R Markdown file Options to choose the type of document and whether you want to create a document, a presentation, a dashboard, or other more specialized formats. Options to change the title and the author. 2.1.6.4 Working directory The working directory of a .Rmd file is the folder where the file is saved. Therefore, R will search for files in the same folder where the .Rmd file is stored. For this exercise, we will simply keep the data we use in the same folder as the .Rmd file. 2.1.6.5 Components of R Markdown YAML: set title, date, and output type. Markdown text: write narrative text. Code chunk: load packages, data, and create visualizations. "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed). You may want to try searching to find the page's new location, or use the table of contents to find the page you are looking for. "]]
